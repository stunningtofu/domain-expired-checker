Certainly! To schedule the script to run periodically using `cron`, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.

2. Edit your crontab file using the following command:
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```

3. Add a new line to schedule the script. For example, if you want to run the script every day at 8 AM, add the following line:
   ```bash
   0 8 * * * /path/to/your/script.sh
   ```
   Replace `/path/to/your/script.sh` with the actual path to your script.

   This cron expression breaks down as follows:
   - `0`: Minute field (run at the beginning of the hour).
   - `8`: Hour field (8 AM).
   - `*`: Wildcard for the day of the month, month, and day of the week (every day).

For example, if you want to run the script every Monday at 9 AM, you can use:
```bash
0 9 * * 1 /path/to/your/script.sh
```

Make sure the script is executable (`chmod +x /path/to/your/script.sh`) and that the paths in the cron expression are absolute or relative to your home directory.
